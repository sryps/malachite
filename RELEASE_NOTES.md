### Resources

- [The tutorial][tutorial] for building a simple application on top of Malachite using the high-level channel-based API.
- [ADR 003][adr-003] describes the architecture adopted in Malachite for handling the propagation of proposed values.
- [ADR 004][adr-004] describes the coroutine effect system used in Malachite.
  It is relevant if you are interested in building your own engine on top of the core consensus implementation of Malachite.
